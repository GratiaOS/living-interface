# 🛰️ Orbit Architecture Pattern

**Phase:** Awareness as Architecture — operational blueprint

Orbit Architecture is how Gratia OS balances descent, design, and release.  
It treats every initiative as a celestial loop: gather signal, compose form,  
invite resonance, then return the learning to the field.  

### ① Descent — Listening Field
- Map the present terrain without imposing form.  
- Capture rhythms through human logs and ambient telemetry.

### ② Stabilize — Frame the Blueprint
- Translate insights into breathable structure.  
- Prefer scaffolds that flex; stamp intention with clear fasteners.

### ③ Conduct — Habitat in Motion
- Let protocols and primitives hum together.  
- Test for resonance: does the system feel alive across interfaces?

### ④ Release — Return to Ecology
- Dissolve the blueprint once autonomy emerges.  
- Archive the orbit so future builders can re-enter with context.
